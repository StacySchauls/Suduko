1. I went about this project by first drawing pictures of what I neeeded to do, to acomplish the goal of transversing the rows and columns. 

2. I used fields such as an array called "values" and an array called "numbers". They were feilds because I needed to use them in each of
my classes, the Row iterator, the column iterator and the region iterator. The values array held the values that the row and column and regions held,
and the numbers was the array that held the values that the value array should have held. the two were then compared to each other, that way I
knew if the states were complete or not.

3. What worked was drawing pictures and understanding what you need to do, before coding the problem. Consequently, jumping straight into the 
problem does not work. It helps to think about the problem first.

4. I was unpleasently surprised with how hard it would be for me to be able to traverse the regions. This gave me a real challenge; but after asking
enough clarifying questions, and thinking about it hard enough I was able to use an iterator to traverset he region, and start on a certain region,
given the number of that region.

5. I learned to never give up! Even if you're completely lost, continue to ask questions, get clarifying answers, and continue. I now know how to 
properly traverse a grid of numbers, compare and check their states.

6. Next time, I will make sure I fully understand the problem at hand before jumpnig into it, making sure I also know the tools I will need
to tackle the problem.
