Stacy Schauls	Sudoku Minimal


1. I went about this project by resaerching containers and components, and how id 
implement these, and how id make a board.

2. Dsign decisions that i made were in the main class. I made the fields "rows" 
"cols" and "size" because //i needed to use them in the constructor as well a in the 
paintComponent of thar class.

3. Wht works is really being able to grasp the flow of how these components and containers
actually work together. What doesnt work is "winging" it. I found that asking for help
really does help.

4. The biggest surprise that I encountered was the fact that I couldnt understnd or figure 
out how to do anything on this asignment. For some reason it was very hard to grasp.

5. I learned to not be afraid to ask for help when I need it.

6.Next time I will do some more research on the topic.
